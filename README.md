#### Help the Rebels  

Greetings my friend. My name is C3PO, and I'm here to deliver a message from the Rebels. Here it goes: 

*"You have been asked by Princess Leia to create a new tool to identify the Rebel ships."* 

##### So what you will be doing
1. Set up the app (run it!)
2. Create a new carousel component to display all the ships based on [the design](https://www.figma.com/file/bCOhQxQvBgNWkE8xptmCnW/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)
3. Create a new page using that component to display the ships
4. Fetch the data from that component using this API
```bash
/api/ships
```
5. When a ship is clicked you need to show a modal to edit the name or description of the ship and save it to the current state (load the current text on the fields).
###### OPTIONAL
6. Modify the API so when the ship is edited it sends that data to the API via PUT method on the same URL.
